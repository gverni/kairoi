# Kairoi

Project Timelines made easy....

This project is a fork of the excellent [d3kit-timeline](https://github.com/kristw/d3kit-timeline) with the following differences:
* Removal of `d3kit` (last commit on this project was Feb 2017)
* Update of D3 version to 5
* Attempt to make it work on IE 10 & 11 as well (see issue [here](https://github.com/kristw/d3kit-timeline/issues/15))

## Demo 

Simple front-end demo using this project can be found [here](https://gverni.github.io/kairoi/)
